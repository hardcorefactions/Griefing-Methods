<p align="center">A documentation about how to destroy Minecraft servers</p>

### Introduction
How griefers get OP (operator privileges) on servers is still a myth for a lot of players, server owners and administrators. In this documentation, you'll learn everything about how to exploit, discover and grief Minecraft networks, and how it all works in details.

I've decided to write this documentation with a full explanation on how to do it, because I've seen a lot of script kiddies selling their "private" methods, where in reality, they're not private at all, nor their own methods.

### Overview
1. Methods
    - **Bypassing**
        - [AuthMeBridge](Bypassing/AuthMeBridge.md) (work in progress)
        - [Exploiting Plugin Managers](Bypassing/Exploiting%20Plugin%20Managers.md)
        - [OnlyProxyJoin](Bypassing/OnlyProxyJoin.md) (work in progress)
        - [UUIDSpoof - Fix](Bypassing/UUIDSpoof%20-%20Fix.md)
    - **Discovering**
        - [Domain to IP](Discovering/Domain%20to%20IP.md)
        - [Dorking](Discovering/Dorking.md) (work in progress)
        - [IP Range Scanning](Discovering/IP%20Range%20Scanning.md) (work in progress)
        - [Port Scanning](Discovering/Port%20Scanning.md) (work in progress)
        - [Reverse Domain Lookup](Discovering/Reverse%20Domain%20Lookup.md) (work in progress)
        - [Reverse IP Lookup](Discovering/Reverse%20IP%20Lookup.md) (work in progress)
        - [SRV Record](Discovering/SRV%20Record.md)
        - [Subdomain Scanning](Discovering/Subdomain%20Scanning.md) (work in progress)
    - **Exploitation**
        - Database Dumping
            - [LiteBans](Exploitation/Database%20Dumping/LiteBans.md)
        - Directory Traversal
            - [Holographic Displays](Exploitation/Directory%20Traversal/Holographic%20Displays.md)
            - [ServerSigns](Exploitation/Directory%20Traversal/ServerSigns.md)
        - [UUID Spoofing](Exploitation/UUID%20Spoofing.md)
        - Getting Server IP
            - [FastAsyncWorldEdit](Exploitation/Getting%20Server%20IP/FastAsyncWorldEdit.md)
            - [PlaceholderAPI](Exploitation/Getting%20Server%20IP/PlaceholderAPI.md)
    - **Social Engineering**
        - [Poisoned Plugin](Social%20Engineering/Poisoned%20Plugin.md)
        - [Session Hijacking](Social%20Engineering/Session%20Hijacking.md)
2. Griefing Process Example
    - [Finding a Vulnerable Server]() (work in progress)
    - [Getting OP]() (work in progress)
    - [Dumping the Servers Database]() (work in progress)
    - [Getting RCON Access through ServerSigns]() (work in progress)
    - [Griefing the Server]() (work in progress)

There are other ways to gain access to a server. E.g. by bruteforcing or hacking into the back-end server through different vulnerabilities. These methods are more advanced and requires knowledge in hacking and exploitation, and will therefore not be added to this documentation, as this documentation is aimed at Minecraft servers only.
